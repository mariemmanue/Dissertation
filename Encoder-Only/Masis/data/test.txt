I wonder do it be like the water we drink that one time
Sometimes Rolanda bed don’t be made up
That teacher, she yell at the kids
What they was doing?
People be on them jobs for thirty year just steady working
I mean, that's the only thing I can say he ever taught me was- All the wrong he done I didn't wanna dabble in it.
Cause I- I don't do this r- I don't do this on a regular basis.
I mean, because that was when I guess, y- if you- if- if you in a- like a closed in like, neighborhood, um, you knew everybody on the entire street.
A guest walk past, how you doing?
And at the time, my grades let me go there.
And cause you, I guess, figure you- you have the mindset it's no consequences for your actions at all.
And f- everybody used to call it that still do.
And I guess word got out through them, they passed on cards to other individuals.
And I think back then it was a lot of rec centers we can go to.
And I think initially that's what got me, um, promoted because it was a instance where my supervisor I guess she was older she was inclined to technology.
And I think that's learned behavior because if you- you- growing up, I mean, everybody don't have that personality.
And I- like I s- I- I- like I said I knew when I first got there he was pretty much dead, but I couldn't say that to her because like I said, I'm not a doctor.
And it was instances where after we been there for a while, we were one on one with individuals probably twice my age.
And it was more- um, more interaction with the kids there and in elementary school.
And like all the- um, the decorations, um, um, the tablecloths and everything, her and her sister pl- uh, picked everything.
And my sister went but I didn't know nothing about it.
And she don't need it now, I mean, it's- it's just gonna- as long as you're living it's gonna be there.
and the average person in the city, some of 'em don't have a car to take their kid to like a- uh, a private school or something like that.
And then a lot of her family members were aksing me, well you have any business cards?
And then they- couple of months- like a month later they went to Cleveland, b- beat the brakes off of 'em.
And they had a housekeeper to t- to take them in the room cause they was like, real real frantic.
And when he saw me, he was like, man why you ain't try out for the team?
And you gotta imagine me, I'm like fifteen sixteen listening to somebody who's like, forty telling me about the problems that they have.
And, um, my mentor a guy named RD-NAME-5 and I- I ran into him like a couple years ago I been friends with him ever since.
Because I always knew I can cook cause my mother from the south, so.
Because it was nobody to follow behind because you don't- you don't know nobody, nah.
Because why would somebody invent I- I guess a slave owner invent like, a gadget or something to make them do their job better?
Birthday is December the first.
Boys has always been like that.
But after a while, I- I guess the performance- um, my performance, uh, he took a liking to.
But growing up, uh, her and like, a couple of my other sister friends probably used to like me.
But how you feel don't matter at the time because you gotta figure the decisions you make is gonna affect other people and the business.
But I think that it's a lot of things that I know I wanted as a child, but I was satisfied with the things that I had because I saw at a early age that my mother was busting her tail to support all of us by herself, so.
But I think that's why they starting to fade it out and close a lot of clubs because of that, what happens afterwards.
But I think the games that's coming up they gotta take advantage of and win.
But I wanted it- I don't wanna get- have it in her mind that- the hate that I have for little boys that she gotta, well I- I don't wanna tell him this.
But I- I don't eat carry out that much no more though.
But I- I- she- she know the difference between stuff that she wants and something that she needs.
But it wasn't one in my house either.
But it- it was more activities then.
But now, looking at it, I shoulda want to play it more because me playing center the average guy that was checking me was bigger and slower.
But what happened was that a couple a years ago- cause her family and my family know each other.
But, I ain't been there in a while.
But, I mean, I never dabbled in- in, I- I never felt the need to.
But, um, now, they- nobody fights anymore.
But, um, they don't have programs like that anymore, though.
Carmelo, he has that He's a ball hog.
Cause I know they not teaching it in school.
Cause I- I don't do this r- I don't do this on a regular basis.
Cause like I said, everybody knew- I mean, the neighborhoods were that close where I can walk across the s- like the, um, football field, and I'm at, um, what's that, it's called Robinson Street.
Cause they play what, the forty-niners?
Cause they- they was from- I can't- forgot what city they was from, but it was nowhere near DC of course.
Cause usually if we have a gathering it's on like a Friday or Saturday.
Cold as ice.
Derrick Rose, he's gonna help.
Didn't know nobody.
Don't know if they a passing team or running team.
During the process, um, they showed up, the ambulance showed up, and they saw what I was doing.
Every little instance we had during practice, temper tantrum.
Everybody just gonna get their touches.
Everything was there cause it was big enough, the rec center was to hold a lot of kids.
Family is really really close.
Girl, she's fifteen.
Guests'll come up to you and hold a conversation with you for a hour if they could, about their day, their kids, um, things that's going on in the area.
He got somebody that's unselfish that will give him the ball.
His ch- he was like, chest felt funny, and his stomach was hurting.
I ain't know you was into, um, sports- basketball fanat- I did not know that.
I didn't really wanna do it, I mean, because I was like, man I- cause I- I- I didn't even plan on being there that long.
I didn't plan anything with it, neither did I wanna have anything to do with- I didn't wanna have anything to do with the planning, cause her sister is a- um, that's what she does on the side, like planning and events and stuff like that.
I don't do that no more.
I don't know if you ever heard of him but his name RD-NAME-4.
I don't- I- I think it might- I mean, just cause LeBron on the team I think it might work, but can the Wizards beat 'em?
I feel it is because- Of course some of the songs they do are like, cover songs of other artists.
I got two bottles at the house ready to And actually I- um, I s- it was like a year ago for my birthday, I went- they had like a- uh, a expo at the convention center.
I heard a call over the radio about a- um, a guest needs assistance.
I know times are different then, but I- I know mothers and parents are younger now, but in my household, it was just my mother.
I mean, all the other teams they lost a lot of good players but they gained a lot of good players as well.
I mean, because that was when I guess, y- if you- if- if you in a- like a closed in like, neighborhood, um, you knew everybody on the entire street.
I mean, But, um, it got to a point where like I said, I was doing the CPR process, it didn't work, they took him to the hospital, he pronounced dead.
I mean, but, um, She probably- I mean, I j- she probably has a interest in boys already I just don't know about it.
I mean, cause I- when I first started doing security, security was looked at the guy with the mean face standing in CVS telling everybody what to- what to do and being mean to people.
I mean, cause you- you- you get to a point where if you go to a jail, it's more- the population- I mean, it- to me, jail is a business.
I mean, I ain't- it wasn't really no big issue at the time, but now that I look at it- but I'm starting to learn more.
I mean, it was violence in the- the neighborhood, so to speak.
I mean, it's nothing really that we could have possibly done to change it because she didn't know and neither we- I mean, we didn't know either I guess he was sick, so.
I mean, of course, there was some altercations, I mean, for the- the dumbest reasons.
I mean, of course, you know, you got a sibling.
I need to find when is the next one.
I never got put out but I was one of the ones, you- you joking with me, my work's done, your's not.
I taught- I- I- everything I've learned from my father I tell my daughter.
I think- and I- I'm not saying it just because it's my family, I don't think it's a family on this planet that's close as we are.
I wish they did but they don't.
I- my father been told me this a long time ago, that, um, more kids are getting charges like, at a high rate for everything now.
It don't exist no more though.
It just- I mean, it's- the system in general I don't- it's a lot of things I don't agree with.
it was like rolling around in my head like, dang should I- what if I'd have got there sooner?
It was like that then, whereas though now, I mean, I would say that's- you walk past people that don't say nothing to you or don't really care.
It- when you decide to be bad, you w- I remember one time I did get in trouble.
It's nothing to fall back on, and I mean, not to say that every, um- Cause I- I- like I said, I didn't think my neighborhood was bad, I mean, you j- I'm- I'm never gonna be a person- and I preach this to my daughter, you never be a product of your environment.
Just because you- you're in bad surroundings, shouldn't mean that you should have the same type of mentality, nah.
Like I said the program called OSAY.
Like, to go get a steak and cheese from the carry out, I don't do that no more.
My cousins, you- sometimes people think we're br- like brothers and sisters.
Neither did I want to.
Never was.
No father figure in his life, um, really really good at a sport but had no guidance.
I mean, because I ran into problems when I was coaching whereas though it was a single mother, child's really really really spoiled.
No k- no in- no inventors, we really never learned about- Charles Drew, that's the only one I remember.
No resources at all.
No, because before you look up, DC will look totally di- it's- it look totally different now but it's gonna get way totally different than what it is now.
No, unless it's a drastic change.
None- neither one of 'em they do well, just average at both.
Not just- Cause I know she aks for a lot.
Now they building these condos, um, new developments, and they moving a majority of the black people that was living in the area to PG.
The rec center, it was a whole lot of rec centers back in the day.
Every corner it was a rec center.
Now, I mean, it's- it's nothing.
It's nothing to fall back on, and I mean, not to say that every, um- Cause I- I- like I said, I didn't think my neighborhood was bad, I mean, you j- I'm- I'm never gonna be a person- and I preach this to my daughter, you never be a product of your environment.
Only thing you putting in there carry outs and liquor stores.
People you didn't know, because if a band played on like, Benning Road, and it's a well-known band, people from- it ain't gonna just be people from Benning Road that go over there to see that band play.
RD-NAME-2 I tell you.
RD-NAME-2 like I say, I'm not a doctor.
Real cool guy.
S- diabetes a little bit, but I'm more conscious now.
I mean, I think the- the youth today, I mean, they have the right, I think, um, mindset as far as like, um, not being scared of anything.
Scared of anything.
Schools are getting overcrowded, the teachers are getting stressed out because they can't deal with the volume of kids that they getting.
She look like she was lost.
She's like one of my sister friends that- It's- it's funny because growing up- She's a little bit younger than me, like probably three years younger than me.
Sister hated it when they used to come over like, where your brother at?
So going there, I'm tall, guys in the twelfth grade, some of 'em, my- my height.
So he was looking at some of the reports and he was like, man no way in hell she wrote this.
So I- I was still doing CPR process until they took over.
So imagine me- I mean, I- I knew I was kind of tall for, uh, high school.
So they play Cleveland Sunday?
So whatever guidelines the organization has those what you gotta follow.
So- and- and m- and me personally I don't think it's for our benefit they building these new developments because if you go down t- Man, I- where- where'd I drive to?
So, I think she hit me on f- on Facebook or she text me or something, asked what I was doing, to come past it.
So, stayed on the team.
Somebody like- some- my- well my cousin could call my aunt, I mean, call my mother and be like, w- what you doing Saturday, and we're like, nothing.
Soon as I get to the door, it was a- um, a older woman like, frantic, screaming and crying.
Stanton Road, Bruce Place, and, um, like Congress Park, too, which is like further down, went to RD-SCHOOL-2 rec center cause every Friday we skated, or the rec center have some type of activities there whether it was sports, or anything, like, cheerleading competition for girls.
The craziest thing, and I- I still- I don't still think about it but when I go past the hotel that cross my mind, it was a instance where it was a, um- And I was assistant director when this happened.
The first expression on your face like, ew, why- why you wanna, um, get involved with my brother and sister?
The rec center, it was a whole lot of rec centers back in the day.
The very next day, I'm walking in the lobby, I run into his wife.
They looking at me like, when you- when- when you get here?
They redoing a whole lot of areas, man, in DC.
Though how it usually works is so if a guest locked out of their room, or somebody needs assistance, whoever's there they call security and we'll respond.
To the point where if I eat something, man I can make this better than this.
Today date is October the fourth two thousand seventeen.
Turns sixteen next year, in August.
Uh, high school I went to, um, RD-SCHOOL-6.
Uh, it's one 'em got a more tangy like, tastes like barbecue- close to barbecue type flavor.
Um, and a lot of schools are getting overcrowded now, because if it- It's a school on .
Um, and it was like twenty of us.
Um, and it's been instances where Bruce Street and Robinson Street, somebody from that area, from- somebody from my area was- um, had conflict at the time.
Um, born on Bruce Place, Southeast.
Um, I would say it's nothing we coulda done, we did everything we could.
Um, involved in interaction with other individuals yeah, where as though now, you got your phone, or computer or laptop, you fine as a child.
Um, just- I mean, and- and you gotta figure you go to a go go, you gonna be there for a couple of hours.
Um, or in somebody yard doing something playing music or something.
Varsity basketball, football though, the football team was I felt- um, it was a couple of players that was there last year, the year before, that should've graduated.
Was like, I ain't- nah, I ain't want to, I'm'a wait the next year.
We turns into him, his wife, my brother and sisters, his brother and sist- well his sisters, uh, my other cousins.
Whereas though back then the older guys, they'll see us, the ones- the guys- the younger guys, you know, that- they know we into sports and we don't deal in that type of activity.
Which means a- anything happen as far as from emergency standpoint whether it a guest or anything, they come to me aksing me questions.
Why you not playing sports?
Without a doubt a Wizards fan.
Yeah but usually I figure during that time I'm like, what, ten.
Yeah, and that's why I talk to my daughter all the time about what's important, I mean, what's gonna be there as she get older.
Yeah, cookout, um, because if she move or what- what's another thing?
You don't.
You feel you'll never get caught, everything you do you'll get away with and it's a reason for everything that you do that's negative.
You is like, you don't want nobody messing with your brother and sister, I mean, because that's your brother and sister.
Yup, and it don't work all the time.
